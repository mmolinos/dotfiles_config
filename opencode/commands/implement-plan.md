Implement it all. Create tasks in subagents, and in those subagents parallelize tasks when they can run without conflicts in PLAN.md. Before starting a task or phase, mark it IN PROGRESS to claim it so no other subagent takes it. When you're done with a task or phase, mark it as completed in the plan document.
Do not stop until all tasks and phases are completed. Do not add unnecessary comments.
Use .agents/skills when they will be needed, and continuously make sure you're not introducing new issues.
Update .opencode/plans/PLAN.md in place as you complete tasks.
