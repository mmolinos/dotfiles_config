I want to build a new feature $ARGUMENTS that extends the system to perform the desired business outcome.
Write a detailed .opencode/plans/PLAN.md document outlining how to implement this and include code snippets.
Use @.opencode/RESEARCH.md as grounding context and align the plan to the current architecture.
