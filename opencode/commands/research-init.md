agent: research-init
subtask: true

Read this folder in depth, understand how it works deeply, what it does and all its specificities.
When that's done, write a detailed report of your learnings and findings in .opencode/RESEARCH.md.
The root path is $ARGUMENTS. If $ARGUMENTS is empty, use ".".
If .opencode/RESEARCH.md already exists, update only the outdated parts and preserve accurate content.
